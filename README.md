# Arcadis Template
This is meant as a template for Arcadians to base new repositories on. Using a template will serve two purposes: 1) it makea creating new repositories easier and faster and 2) it will help drive consistency between repositories.

# Must be internal
A big goal of having a central code repository platform in place is facilitating knowledge sharing between Arcadians. Therefore all Arcadis repositories should be set to 'Internal'. Only if there is a very good reason (client confidentially for example) and if you have management approval, it is allowed to make repositories private. 

If you create a private repository, you need to justify why it is private and you need to document this reason plus the management apporoval of this decision in the file called PRIVATE.

Note that the existence of a repository (and the repository name) plus the content of the README.MD file will be shared within Arcadis even for private repositories. 

# Must be in English
All code, comment and documentation in all repositories must by in English. Sometimes it may be necessary to also have documentation in another language. That is allowed as an addition to English documentation, but not as a replacement of English docuementation.
