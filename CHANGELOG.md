# What is a Changelog
The changelog file is representation of changes in your application features. It should contain the release version related description along with a link to the Azure Boards PBI. As a standard practice, we encourage every team to practice Semantic Versioning to cut a new release. You can read about it [here](https://arcadiso365.sharepoint.com/teams/pda/SitePages/Git-Flow%20commands.aspx). Below is an example of a Changelog for reference.
